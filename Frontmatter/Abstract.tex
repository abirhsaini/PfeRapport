\hspace{10pt}This work is part of my end-of-studies project carried out within the company 4D in order to obtain the title of State Engineer in Digital Services Development at the Institut National des Postes et Télécommunications.

My mission was to develop an online training platform for 4D. This internal project of the company aims to provide employees of the company as well as clients with a shared space where they can access various training sessions, whether they are related to 4D or other subjects.

To succeed in this project, we started with a thorough analysis of the project in order to identify the functional and technical requirements that the solution must meet. In a second step, we conducted a conceptual study translated into diagrams. Finally, we initiated the development and implementation of the solution.

The project was implemented using the React Framework on the Front End and 4D for the backend.
